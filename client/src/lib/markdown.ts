  'deep-learning-fundamentals': `# Deep Learning Fundamentals: Building Blocks of Neural Networks

## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computational systems inspired by the human brain's neurological structure. At their core, they consist of interconnected nodes or "neurons" organized in layers:

- **Input Layer**: Receives initial data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information through weighted connections
- **Output Layer**: Produces the final result

## Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity, allowing networks to learn complex patterns:

- **ReLU**: Rectified Linear Unit, defined as f(x) = max(0, x)
- **Sigmoid**: Maps values to range (0,1), useful for probabilities
- **Tanh**: Similar to sigmoid but maps to range (-1,1)
- **Softmax**: Converts values to probability distribution, common in classification

## Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the core algorithm for training neural networks:

1. Forward pass computes prediction
2. Error is calculated using a loss function
3. Gradients are computed backward through the network
4. Weights are updated proportionally to their contribution to the error

## Optimization Algorithms

Several algorithms exist to efficiently update network weights:

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Updates weights using small batches
- **Adam**: Adaptive Moment Estimation, combines momentum and RMSProp
- **RMSProp**: Adapts learning rates for each parameter

## Regularization Techniques

To prevent overfitting, regularization methods are essential:

- **Dropout**: Randomly deactivates neurons during training
- **L1/L2 Regularization**: Penalizes large weights
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes layer inputs, improving stability
- **Data Augmentation**: Artificially expands training dataset

## Common Architectures

Modern deep learning relies on several fundamental architectures:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for grid-like data (images)
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Process sequential data with memory
- **Transformers**: Attention-based models revolutionizing NLP
- **Autoencoders**: Learn efficient data encodings unsupervised

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning leverages pre-trained models for new tasks:

1. Take a model trained on a large dataset
2. Freeze some layers to retain learned features
3. Replace and retrain top layers for the new task
4. Fine-tune if necessary

This approach dramatically reduces required training data and computation time, making deep learning accessible for more applications.`,

  'transformer-architecture': `# The Transformer Architecture: Attention is All You Need

## Introduction to Transformers

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., revolutionized natural language processing and beyond. Unlike previous sequential models (RNNs, LSTMs), Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously through self-attention mechanisms.

## Core Components

### Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention module computes relationships between all positions in a sequence:

1. Input embeddings are transformed into Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors
2. Attention scores are computed as scaled dot products between Q and K
3. Scores are normalized via softmax function
4. Final outputs are weighted sums of V vectors

Mathematically represented as: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V

### Multi-Head Attention

Rather than performing a single attention function, multi-head attention runs multiple attention operations in parallel:

- Allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces
- Concatenates outputs from different attention heads
- Projects through a final linear layer

### Position Encodings

Since Transformers process all tokens simultaneously, they need position information:

- Sinusoidal position encodings add spatial information
- Learned position embeddings are an alternative approach
- These ensure the model knows token order

### Feed-Forward Networks

Each Transformer block contains a fully connected feed-forward network:

- Usually consists of two linear transformations with ReLU activation
- Processes each position independently
- Often has a larger internal dimension than the model dimension

## Encoder-Decoder Structure

### Encoder

- Stack of identical layers with multi-head attention and FFN
- Each layer has residual connections and layer normalization
- Final output contains contextual representations of input

### Decoder

- Similar structure to encoder with additional cross-attention
- Masked self-attention prevents attending to future positions
- Cross-attention attends to encoder output

## Impact and Evolution

Transformers have led to breakthrough models like:

- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations
- GPT series: Generative Pre-trained Transformers
- T5: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer
- Vision Transformers (ViT): Adapting Transformers for computer vision

The architecture scales effectively with more parameters and training data, explaining the trend toward increasingly large language models.`,
